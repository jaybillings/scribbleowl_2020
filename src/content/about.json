      "copy": "I have been programming professionally for over a decade, but web development has been a passion of mine since I published my first Geocities page in the late 90s. And while my career began in the front end, I've intentionally grown my knowledge over the years to include backend work as well as provisioning. I have developed within a variety of languages and frameworks, from Java applets to Python MVC to .NET-powered Angular to WordPress. My most recent projects been within the Node.js ecosystem, specifically React."

      "copy": "Development, especially front end development, is about more than the code. The most beautifully coded webapp is useless if users don't want to or can't use it. Aside from technology, my two main passions are visual art and fiction writing, and this has combined into a strong sense of interactive design which informs all my development decisions. I understand what the design team is trying to say and can work with them to ensure their ideas translate to the finished project."

      "copy": "The best developers are those who know their code well enough to explain it to a non-technical audience. I am a great believer in the importance of clear communication in all its forms, whether it means adding documentation for a new API or meeting with the marketing team to ensure everyone's goals are aligned for the upcoming launch. It also means ensuring everyone has access to the same information by coding with accessibility in mind."
